the numebr of people with different qualifications. there are 3 .py files for different analysis and figures, each file saves the resulting figure as a .png file.
the unit tests are all within the UnitTests.py file that make sure all the data is consistent and in the correct format. Some summary statistics for the dataset 
are included in separate .py file to help with my analysis in the report.
